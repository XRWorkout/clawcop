<!-- ═══════════ THE PROBLEM ═══════════ -->
<section class="problem">
  <div class="wrap">
    <div class="eyebrow">The real problem</div>
    <h2 class="sect-heading">The docs say "just install it."<br>They don't say <em>where.</em></h2>

    <div class="problem-cols">
      <div class="problem-prose">
        <p>
          OpenClaw is the most capable AI agent most people will ever run. It manages your code, your calendar, your files, your browser. It needs to be <strong>always on, always fast, always reachable</strong> — and it needs to not bankrupt you in API costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the docs don't help you choose infrastructure. They assume you already know. Self-host on a Mac Mini? Spin up a VPS? Use a managed hosting provider? Each has tradeoffs in cost, latency, uptime, security, and complexity that <strong>nobody explains clearly.</strong>
        </p>
        <div class="pullquote">
          "I burned three weekends setting up a VPS before realizing my use case was perfect for a $30/month hosted plan."
        </div>
        <p>
          The wrong choice doesn't just cost money. It costs momentum. You spend weeks fighting infrastructure instead of using the tool. And by the time you realize, you're emotionally invested in the wrong setup.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>We've deployed OpenClaw in every configuration that exists.</strong> We know which setups survive and which ones get abandoned. One call, and you'll know too.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="problem-cards">
        <div class="problem-card">
          <h3>Self-Host Pitfall</h3>
          <p>You buy a Mac Mini, spend a weekend configuring it, then realize you need it available when you're away from home. Now you're learning about Tailscale, dynamic DNS, and port forwarding.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="problem-card">
          <h3>VPS Pitfall</h3>
          <p>You spin up a $20/mo droplet. It works — until you need persistent browser sessions, GPU access, or more than 2GB of RAM. The upgrade path is a minefield of provider lock-in.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="problem-card">
          <h3>Hosted Pitfall</h3>
          <p>You sign up for a managed service. Easy — but now you're paying $200/mo for something you could run for $40 if you just knew how. And your data lives on someone else's server.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="problem-card">
          <h3>The Hidden Cost</h3>
          <p>Whichever you pick wrong, migration is brutal. Data, configs, skill setups, messaging bridges — nothing transfers cleanly. The cost of getting it wrong isn't the hosting bill. It's starting over.</p>

<!-- ═══════════ FAQ ═══════════ -->
<section class="faq-sect" id="faq">
  <div class="wrap">
    <div class="eyebrow">FAQ</div>
    <h2 class="sect-heading">Before you book.</h2>

    <div class="faq-list">
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do you actually install OpenClaw for me?</h3>
        <p>This consultation is focused on strategy — choosing the right infrastructure and giving you a deployment plan. If you want hands-on installation, we offer that as a separate service. Many clients use the consultation to decide, then book installation after. But you'll have a detailed enough checklist to DIY if you prefer.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>I'm not technical at all. Will I understand the call?</h3>
        <p>Yes. We explain everything in plain English — no jargon, no assumptions. About 40% of our clients are non-technical. You don't need to know what a VPS is before the call. You will after.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why is a 30-minute call $477?</h3>
        <p>Because it replaces $2,400 in bad decisions. Our consultants have deployed 200+ OpenClaw instances and track infrastructure costs across every major provider. You're not paying for 30 minutes of time — you're paying for the accumulated knowledge that makes those 30 minutes worth more than 30 hours of research. If the call doesn't deliver that value, you get a full refund.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's the difference between 30 and 60 minutes?</h3>
        <p>The 30-minute session answers your core question: which infrastructure and which provider. The 60-minute session builds your entire deployment architecture — security, messaging, skills, backups, scaling. If you already know roughly what you want and need validation, go with 30. If you're starting from scratch or deploying for a team, the 60 is worth it.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What if I already have OpenClaw running?</h3>
        <p>Even better. We'll audit your current setup, identify what's costing you unnecessarily, and recommend optimizations. Many clients save 40–60% on monthly costs after a single session. We can also assess whether you should migrate to a different infrastructure entirely.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's the money-back guarantee?</h3>
        <p>If you finish the consultation and don't feel it was worth every dollar, tell us within 48 hours and we'll refund you in full. No questions, no hassle. We've never had to issue one.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How quickly can I book?</h3>
        <p>Most slots are available within 48 hours. Once booked, you'll receive an intake form immediately. We review it before your call so we hit the ground running — no warmup, no wasted time.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is this affiliated with OpenClaw?</h3>
        <p>No. We're independent consultants. We have no financial relationship with any hosting provider, hardware manufacturer, or the OpenClaw project. Our only incentive is giving you the right answer — because our reputation depends on it.</p>
